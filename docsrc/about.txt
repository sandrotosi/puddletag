About puddletag
---------------

puddletag is just a tag editor. Although it's likely better than what you're used to (unless you've used Mp3tag, in which case it's kinda like what you're used to).

Thank yous
----------

First off, a big thanks to **Evan Devetzis** for working tirelessly in helping me make puddletag better by contributing many, many awesome ideas and for being a great bug hunter.

To the writers of the libraries puddletag depends on (without which I'll probably still be writing an id3 reader).

+ **Paul McGuire** for PyParsing and for being extraordinarily helpful.
+ **Michael Urman** and **Joe Wreschnig** for Mutagen (It. Is. Awesome).
+ **Nokia, Phil Thomson** and all parties responsible for PyQt4.
+ **Michael Foord** and **Nicola Larosa** for ConfigObj (seriously, they should replace ConfigParser with this).
+ The **Oxygen team** for the Oxygen icons.

And for those who've contributed, the people whose code I stole, those who helped me out on discussion boards and to open-source creators, **Thanks a bunch**.
