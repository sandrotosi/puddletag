29 August 2020 - Python3
########################

It's finally here!

(I [Keith] personally had nothing to do with it). This release is thanks to Sandro Tosi and the amazing people below.

- blueblots
- Elizabeth M
- elsabio
- klslz
- Marko Hauptvogel
- Pedro M. Baeza
- Steven Saus

There are no new features, but probably a bit more bugs. This release is purely about updating puddletag to Python3 and PyQt5.

Cheers!
