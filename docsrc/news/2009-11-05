New Features
------------

* The only new feature for this release is that the MusicBrainz dialog now allows you to select individual tracks. I like it better now.

Changes
-------

* Some (actually many) bugs with loading directories were fixed.

There won't be any releases until at least February next year as I'm gonna take some time of from puddletag (and python) to learn new stuff and hopefully with enough new knowledge to implement the advanced features that I've been thinking of. If I do discover some critical bugs during this time though, I'll update the site.
