16 December 2010 - 0.9.8
########################

This'll be the last release for a while as I'm taking a break from puddletag development. I'll still be lurking in the forums and issue tracker, so don't hesitate to ask for help or report bugs.

All in all this has been a good year for puddletag. It went from kinda-working to better than anything else on Linux. Besides myself you gotta thank Evan for that. Without his constant feedback, testing and feature requests puddletag would be way less than it is.

So yeah, some goals (like better WMA support) haven't been met, but on the whole I'm satisfied with the way things turned out. The next planned release will be around mid to late March 2011, although I might do one in late January to update translations and plugins. Any other releases before March 2011 will be bugfix releases.

New Features
------------

*   puddletag now supports translations. If you want to create one for your language create an on the |issue_tracker|_.
*   A :ref:`new Function <convert_from_non_standard_encoding>` to correct incorrectly encoded files contributed by Stjujsckij Nickolaj.
*   :ref:`Tag->Dir <tag_to_dir>`, with which you can move directories has also been included.
*   MoveUp and MoveDown shortcuts that move the selected files Up/Down in file-view.
*   The MusicBrainz tag source now retrieves even more fields. See :ref:`here <musicbrainz>` for a complete listing.
*   **Select all in Dir** has been removed. I've added two new menu items. Select Next in Dir and Select Previous Dir. Info can be found :ref:`menus <select_next>`.
*   Support for GUI and music library plugins. There aren't any docs yet. I'll add them in mid January. If you want to do development in the mean time, make a post on the forum and I'll help you out.
*   A tag source that uses Discogs.com's XML service. I'm not sure how complete this tag source is since Discogs.com's documentation is woefully inadequate. :ref:`Info <discogs>`. **You must set the User-Agent to use this!**.
*   puddletag now uses your theme's icons. Thanks to `this <http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/puddletag/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=16#p178>`_ post.
*   I've added (tentative) support for Mp3tag's tag sources. Info :ref:`here <mp3tag_sources>`.
*   The '~'-notation used in Tag Sources can now be used for Functions too. See the bottom of :doc:`this <source/tut3>` page.
*   Options to remove ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags separately to the Tag Tools menu.
*   You can now automatically retrieve matches using Tag Sources. Kinda like mini-masstagging.

Changes
-------

*    The Replace with Regular Expression function now starts from $1 instead of $0. I had to do this in order for Mp3tag's Tag Sources to work. Please update your actions.
*    Previews in the Functions dialog now show the fields too.
*    Action Shortcuts settings have been moved from Preferences to the Actions dialog.
*    Tools->Sort Selected is now Tools->Sort By. Visit this :ref:`page <sort_option_prefs>` for info.
*    performer in ID3 has been changed to albumartist.

Fixes
-----

*   MP4 mappings and handling of unicode fields in MP4 files.
*   ID3's rating didn't handle missing parameters well.
*   Not loading APEv2 tags with cover art.
*   Crashes due to renaming many directories at once.
*   Undo errors while in Preview Mode.
*   Quick Actions weren't working at all.
*   Bug in Amazon Tag Source while retrieving small images.
*   Loading playlist's with any contained file's having commas.
*   Tag Panel not saving if genre isn't present.
*   and more...

Website changes
---------------

*   I've added another tutorial called :doc:`Things you should know <source/tut3>`. You probably know some of it already.
*   Documentation for Preferences has been added :doc:`here <source/preferences>`.
