A bug was discovered in Discogs that'd make it fail on the vast majority of albums (just not the ones I tested with). This release is to fix that. But I've included the following too:

New Features
------------

*   Discogs uses the Discogs ID field (which you can define) if it's found in your files.
*   You can use your own Amazon and Discogs API keys.
*   **__counter** and **__total_files** fields which you can use in Functions and Actions. Info :doc:`here <source/tags>`.

Fixes
-----

*   Case Sensitivity for field names is handled better.
