New Features
------------

* A super useful duplicates finder. It's not as well tested as I'd like so I'll make that a priority for the next release. Currently it only works on the supported music libraries. I'll add support for arbitrary folders during the month.
* Rudimentary file-management support had been added to the filesystem view.
* Note that I haven't added any progress bars for these features (due in a week) so just have patience when using them (and keep an eye on the command line for errors).

Changes
-------

* I've changed the config system to use ConfigObj as PyQt4's too buggy and Python's built in library too much of a pain. Because of this, I recommend you remove ~/.puddletag/puddletag.conf just to avoid any adverse effects from using the new config style.
* Amarok library support has been removed due to the fact that it'll probably not work on any machine but mine (and that's not even guaranteed).

Fixes
-----

* Bugs were fixed where needed (I seriously need to remember to log this stuff)

Website changes
---------------

* It looks tons better.
* A :doc:`screenshots <screenshots>` section was added. I'll up some videos during the month if I get time.
