Besides not having much time, I have been very lazy this month when it came to puddletag. If all goes well then the next release will be more bountiful. Till then, you'll have to make due with this, which only has the following to offer...

New Features
------------

* Loading times are improved by a couple of miliseconds.
* I've implemented a bit of fuzzy string matching via the Show Dupes button. Enter a tag prepended by a colon (like **":title** and values will be fuzzily matched. It uses the `python-Levenshtein <http://code.michael-noll.com/?p=third-party;a=tree;f=python-Levenshtein-0.10.1>`_ for matching. If you don't have it installed, difflib (part of the standard library) is used. There isn't much difference except that Levenshtein is supposed to be faster since it's compiled (I haven't tested it though). Furthermore, entering **:artist** in the library search box will show you all the fuzzily matched duplicate artists.

Changes
-------

* I just changed the UI a bit to make it more coherent. It's still ugly as hell, but that's way outta my area of expertise.

Fixes
-----

* There are many. I spent some time writing unit tests and testing the critical parts of puddletag. Many bugs were found. Many of these bugs weren't logged. This being said, there may still be some bugs as I've once again made some internal changes that could mess up things. Expect one or two updates during the month.
