11 August 2010 - 0.9.3
######################


Because of time commitments and the complexity of the new features, this release is a bit late...and a bit unfinished. I'm releasing it, because it contains too many bugfixes to keep to myself (and those using svn).

Trust me when I say 0.9.4, due the 25th, will be awesome.

New Features
------------

* I've added WavPack, MusePack, and basic WMA support (only common fields, not including artwork are supported.)
* *Masstagging*. Also known as the time-sink, was added. What this allows you to do is retrieve tags from multiple tag sources at once, combine time and write them to the selected files. It sounds simple, but extremely useful. There's no tutorial for it as yet (soon), but I think the interface is pretty self-explanatory.
* Also, I've added what I call Preview Mode, wherein you can do all your editing and write to files only once. See the description for it on the :doc:`menus page <source/menus>` (scroll to bottom).
* A new Function called 'Load Artwork' Function with which you can load artwork from the file's directory. Explanation can be found on the :doc:`functions page <source/function>`.
* The plugin interface is now public for Functions. Tag sources will be available in the next release. For those interested, there's a tutorial :doc:`here <source/plugins>`.
* Converting filenames to tags can now take the directory name into account. Description on :doc:`menus page <source/menus>`.

Bugs
----

* Some Tag Panel Bugs, including entries being replaced if an autocompletion was found of differing case. Genres always being Acapella and when adding entries like Blues\\Rock not being separated properly. And puddletag crashing on loading non-ASCII genres.
* Copy/Paste not working correctly sometimes.
* Saving artwork using Extended tags would clear the artwork instead if the cover differed between files. Sorry 'bout that one.
* Duplicate entries in comboboxes for the Functions dialog are now removed.
* A whole bunch of small ones which may have caused problems for someone somewhere.
