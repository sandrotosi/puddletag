9 February 2011 - 0.9.12
########################

Almost all the work done, was modifying the code base so that puddletag could be translated properly. I've put up a :doc:`translation guide <source/translate>` for interested parties. Since this is a bug-fix release, there are no new features, just some changes and fixes.

Changes
-------

*   Users stuck using python-musicbrainz2 < 0.7.0 shouldn't have problems with puddletag crashing on startup.
*   Nor is python-musicbrainz2 a hard dependency any more.
*   The default user agent now set to puddletag/0.9.12. New users will be able to use the Discogs Tag Source 'out of the box'.
*   I might've used some things available only in newer Qt versions. If you're using Qt/PyQt >= 4.5 and puddletag crashes, `let me know <http://code.google.com/p/puddletag/issues>`_.

Fixes include, but are not limited to
-------------------------------------

*    Editing **__dirname** and **__dirpath** while using QuodLibet library is now possible + tons of Music Library related bugs.
*    Editing Actions sometimes didn't work.
*    The **Load Artwork** function didn't work as advertised.
*    **%__total_files%** and **%__counter%** not working when used within scripting functions.
*    The Artwork Window is floating by default. Fixes an issue whereby the puddletag window would be larger than the screen.
