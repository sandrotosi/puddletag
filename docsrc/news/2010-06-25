Just a couple of things this time. I spent most of my time on backend stuff. Next week will be dedicated to tag sources, so expect some major additions/improvements on that side.

New Stuff:
----------

* Moving files using Tag->File is now supported. See the `functions page <source/functions>`_ for examples.
* And using it as an part of an action is possible too.
* The option to not write ID3v1 tags.
* Complete rewrite of the tag sources backend. Now you can sort the tag sources window using any field you want.

Fixes
-----

* A bug where the same value is shown for user-defined fields in ID3 tags.
* The artwork windows resizing by itself (when not docked).

Changes
-------

* The Replace with regular expression function now works like Mp3tag's. i.e only replacing matches instead of overwriting whatever field it was writing to.
* Extended tags now shows changes properly.
