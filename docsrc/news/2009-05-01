I like so this release so much that I almost changed it to puddletag version 1, but it still has some shortcomings compared to Mp3tag and some things that I want to implement before then.

With that being said, here are the changes you'll notice.

New Features
------------
* Saving and loading is now loads faster. On par with Mp3tag (sometimes puddletag is faster, sometimes Mp3tag).
* Like Mp3tag, puddletag stores a history of all the values you've used for the Format Value function, and every other one. Unlike Mp3tag, puddletag allows you delete any entries you don't want on-the-fly, by clicking the red button next to it!
* Cut, Copy and Paste of tags is supported. Available via the Edit menu.

Changes
-------

* All window related actions were move to a new Windows menu to reduce clutter on the edit menu.
* A progress indicator is now shown when loading a music library.
* Settings are stored in ~/.puddletag instead of the ~/.config...

Fixes
-----

* Bugs in the image editor (changing picture type, enabling buttons depending on context, etc.) are fixed.
* Clicking Cancel while loading or saving now actually works as expected and instantly.
* The progress window doesn't stay persistent anymore when puddletag loads or saves files too quickly.
