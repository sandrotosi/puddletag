A couple of critical bugs were found in the last release, they've all been fixed.

Provided nothing critical arises, there won't be any releases until at least late next month.

Fixes
-----

* Deleting tags when they contain mapped fields.
* Functions operating on multiple values like Merge Field were broken.
* peformersortorder is spelt correctly as performersortorder for ID3 tags.
* Renaming directories when intermediate directories are to be created.
