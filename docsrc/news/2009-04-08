Besides the bugfixes in the minor releases last month, the changes this month include...

* M4A support(You need mutagen 1.9 or greater in order not to get any error messages)
* Bugfixes galore
* A console version(in the main directory as console.py). I've been pressed for time, so expect documentation to be added over the coming week.

P.S. This version is 0.5.8, because it's not tested as much as I'd like, so expect many bugfixes over the coming month.
