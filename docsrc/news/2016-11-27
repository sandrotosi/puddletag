27 November 2016 - 1.2.0
########################

Minor fixes were made over the course of the year. This release is so that package maintainers can update their repos.

A Debian package is no longer supplied, supporting two versions of Ubuntu and Debian from a single .deb would take way too much time. For Ubuntu users, `WebUpd8 <http://www.webupd8.org/>`_ keeps their `PPA <https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/ubuntu/webupd8>`_ up to date.
