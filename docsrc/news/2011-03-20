######################

Another incremental-bugfix release. I might release another one before month-end.

New Features
------------

* A bunch of new fields related to Mp3tag compatibility, most notably **__tag** and **__tag_read**. All are listed on the :doc:`source/tags`.
* Loading subfolders can be turned on/off using the Filesystem Window.
* USLT Frame support for ID3 that uses the same format as ID3. See the :ref:`ID3 page <uslt>`.
* The Stored Tags window shows the values of all tags found in file.
* Experimental ID3v2.3 support courtesy of `MusicBrainz Picard <http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardTagger>`_. Multiple values are not supported. Don't use it for now unless you really need to. Then report back on how it went. Enable it in Edit->Preferences->Tags.
* Two new plugins. Details are on the :ref:`Downloads <plugin_downloads>` page.

Fixes
-----

*   Major MP4 fixes.
*   Retrieving PUIDS using the MusicBrainz tag source.
*   Adding album art from Tag Source was defective.
*   The Tag Panel not updating with 'previewed' values.
*   Properties window not showing for certain file types.

Changes
-------

*   Values in the Stored Tags window aren't emboldened anymore due to performance reasons.
*   WMA support has been completely removed due to the high risk that you'd end up with damaged files.
