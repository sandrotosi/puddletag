3 August 2020 - some updates
############################

Sandro Tosi has gracefully been spearheading the effort to port puddletag to Python3. Once done I'll put out a release for testing. There is no timeline as yet and we'll take things as they go.

To prepare for this, we've moved puddletag to a new puddletag organisation. You can find it at https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag/ even though existing
links should just redirect.
