It's December and the sun is out. As such, all I have to show is just a couple of bugfixes (in particular, the import from file window not saving tags) and a message that appears in the statusbar when an error occurs while editing a file.

Don't expect any updates until the 20th of January. If everything works out I'll have at least one feature that sets puddletag apart from any tag-editor I've ever seen and propel puddletag into greatness.
