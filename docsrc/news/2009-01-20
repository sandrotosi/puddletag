Got a bunch of updates for ya.

First as promised, the feature is called **Import Your Music Library (Tools -> Import Music Library)**. Like I said, I haven't seen it before anywhere else. The reason (I think) it because it's extremely difficult to do well. Right now, only three types of music libraries are supported: Prokyon3 (which is what I use), Rhythmbox (which is what a lot of other people use, why?) and Amarok (before version 2).
I have to mention a couple of caveats though. If your music library is spread out across many devices (on another server especially), don't use puddletag to edit the library, because I haven't taken those conditions into account. Concerning Rhythmbox, you'll notice that it has a save button above the Library tree. Use this to save files to the database, because it takes a while to do for large libraries.
Expect these irritants to be gone two weeks from now.

Now for the other added stuff
-----------------------------

*  The user interface is a bit more customizable then before. The Tag editor and Filesystem windows are now tool windows. So you can drag them around and do whatever you want. Use the items on the Edit menu to show and hide these windows.
* Saving and writing images to id3 tags is now supported. You can do this via the extended tags dialog. Besides that, user defined tags are now supported(as long as the don't conflict with any of internal puddletag tags). Oh, and having multiple values per tag is now possible too.
* Like Mp3tag, the Preferences dialog now contains an extra option to edit all the patterns you've created using the patterncombo. Use it when you need to.

Stuff that's fixed
------------------

* My Kubuntu cd arrived a couple of days ago and puddletag (besides having some bugs) looked atrocious. All these are fixed now, and all ya'll Kubuntu users who haven't been able to use puddletag can now share in the joy.
* There was a pretty nasty bug where puddletag would remove any unsupported tags. Sorry about that, hopefully you haven't lost any priceless info because of it.

I'm sure there's a bunch of other stuff, but I can't remember and I'm to lazy to look at previous versions, so you'll just have to see for yourself. Oh, there's a `puddletag subreddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/puddletag>`_ now too.
