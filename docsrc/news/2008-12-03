Stuff that's added
------------------

* Genres! Now you don't have to remember all of them.
* Press Ctrl+W to switch between the file-view, pattern combo and the tag panel.
* A splash screen for the long loads at the beginning to keep you company.
* FLAC and APEv2 tags are now supported (only text tags, not images). Feedback on these would be appreciated as I have a serious lack of FLAC on my PC.

Stuff that's fixed:
-------------------

* The musicbrainz dialog doesn't freeze up puddletag anymore. Note that the threading is implemented in a very roughshod way though, so don't hesitate to contact me if behaves in unexpected ways.
* The main window's layout in addition to its size is now saved.
