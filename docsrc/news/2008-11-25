Stuff that's added
------------------

* A filter like in Mp3tag. F3 shows/hides it.
* Musicbrainz support(Available on the toolbar and Tools -> Musicbrainz). Not sure how good it is. Send me a mail if you have any ideas on improving it.
* The extended tags dialog is now available via the Tools menu(and by right clicking on the file-view).

Stuff that's fixed
------------------

* Saving a file's album art to disk now works.
* The importing tags text files dialog now looks better, by bolding the tags instead of the ugly interface puddletag had before.
* Not everything moves around when resising puddletag anymore and the layout is saved from the previous session.
