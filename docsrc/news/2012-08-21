v1 has finally arrived!

There's not much difference between this and RC1 though. Just a change of icon and minor fixes. If you want to have a look at the :download:`changelog`.

Right now puddletag is about as stable as it'll get without much more work. As for the future, I have a some things that I've been putting off until v1. A command line version being top priority.

Anyway, that's it for now. Enjoy!
