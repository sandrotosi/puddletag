New Features
------------
* A Stored Tags dialog that shows the current tags of the selected file as stored on disk. Useful for when editing libraries and the tag differs from the tag on disk.
* I added an option to allow retrieval of duplicates via a specific tag. This can speed things up for some searches.
* A properties dialog as in Mp3tag (but slightly different) in addition to a delete tags button.
* And finally, a setup script.

Changes
-------
* Instead of changing the background colour of a row, the Musicbrainz dialog now just emboldens the text that's to be written. It's better this way.

Fixes
-----
* Duplicates can retrieve more than 300 at a time. (My fault for not checking.)
* Musicbrainz now works for all cases (it gave an error when retrieving via 'album').
* There ain't no more barfing of errors while editing text in the pattern combo.
* Reloading works again (didn't even know it was broken).

For the next release I'm gonna give Musicbrainz lots of attention. It really needs it.
