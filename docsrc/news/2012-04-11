##########################

**18 April 2012 - Updated to 1.0.0beta6 to fix issues with deb. This is the second last beta.**

This release contains a ton of fixes with regards to Tag Sources.

Fixes
-----

+   MusicBrainz works.
+   Discogs works better with regards to VA albums.
+   Amazon works again.

New Features
------------
+   **__md5_sig** field for FLAC.
+   **$regex** scripting function.
+   Dutch Translation by Fabian Bakkum.
+   Added AcoustID support, but not for general use yet due to the heavy dependency load. Do not try to make it work unless you're an 'advanced' user.

That's it basically. If you want more, see the :download:`changelog`. Docs for the latest version have been uploaded `here <http://puddletag.sf.net/latest/docs.html>`_. I still have quite a bit of updating to do though.
