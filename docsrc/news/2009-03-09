Nope, still don't got no console version(been busy with other stuff, definitely next month).

Anyway, some changes from the last release include:

* The ability to search the music libraries (albeit slowly).
* A totally revamped parsing system(though it'll look the same from the users point of view).
* Like Mp3tag, Actions are now stored separately instead of in one big file.
* Two extra toolbar buttons, "In library" and 'Show Dupes".
* If a library is loaded then "In library?" hides all the files that are not in the library.
* "Show Dupes" hides all the files in the file-view that doesn't have a duplicate(in the file-view).
* ...and a ton of bugfixes, most of which I can't remember(but which are in the svn logs...well, not really)

For the next release I'll concentrate on supporting the rest of Mutagen's supported formats, fixing bugs and smoothing the user interface(progress when loading a library, faster search, etc.).

Expect some interim updates over the next couple of days and a complete release in about a month (1 April 2009).
