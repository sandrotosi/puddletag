As promised, this release is awesome. The next one will be in a couple of weeks, it'll include some features I've been promising for a while.

New Features
------------

* Profiles were added to MassTagging, which means now you can do a configuration once and use that forever.
* Renaming files is now possible within Preview Mode.
* A new Function called 'Remove Fields' that does exactly that.
* A new scripting function (contributed by Erik Reckase) that'll convert unicode strings to ASCII.
* The plugin interface for tag sources is now public. See the docs :doc:`here <source/function>`.
* Right click on any directory. Click the refresh button to refresh it.
* You can now change the shortcut for any menu item. Edit->Preferences->Shortcuts to configure.
* Also, you can now sort selected tracks using predefined fields. Some defaults are in Tools->Sort Selected. Configure it using the 'Edit sort options' button in Preferences.
* I've finally added a :download:`RSS Feed <rss.xml>` to the website.

Bugs
----

* Some bugs related to Preview Mode not working correctly.
* A bunch of others that aren't really worth mentioning.

Changes
-------

* I've changed the way Tag Sources store their settings, so you'll need to reconfigure them.
