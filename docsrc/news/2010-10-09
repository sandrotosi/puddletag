This release is a bit late, but packed with features.

New Features
------------

*   Actions and Functions now operate and write multiple-valued fields.
*   A bunch of new Functions. All listed on the :doc:`functions <source/function>`.
*   Two new scripting functions copied straight from Mp3tag, **$meta_sep** and **$meta**. See the :doc:`scripting functions <source/scripting>` page for details.
*   A new icon. This one designed by Yianni Pappas-Acreman.
*   A new Tag Tools menu, with which you can remove ID3 and APEv2 tags from files where they don't belong.
*   Configurable confirmations. Like when you want to Rename Directories, etc.
*   A __dirname field. Modify this field to rename the directory.
*   UFID frames for ID3v2 Tags.
*   Monkey's Audio File's are now supported.
*   The Actions and Functions dialogs can now be tool windows too (See Windows Menu).
*   All :doc:`docs <docs>` have been updated.

Fixes
-----

*   If it was broken before, it probably works now.
*   The one major fix is that you can load files with messed up encodings now, instead of having puddletag choke on them.

Changes
-------

*   Files that have previews now have a green background while in Preview Mode (Configurable in Edit->Preferences).
*   The configuration for the MusicBrainz Tag Source has been removed. Instead I've opted to return MusicBrainz fields (Album ID, Artist ID, Track ID) by default in mbrainz_track_id, mbrainz_album_id and mbrainz_artist_id. I've also set up default mappings, so that these fields are written to the correct field for each format. Remove ~/.puddletag/mappings to get these.
