Well, it's been more than a month and now major new issues have been report.

There's not much to tell, but here's some things anyway.

Stuff in this release:
----------------------

+ Escaped chars in functions weren't being escaped correctly. Check your functions if they make use of this odd behaviour.
+ Opus support.
+ Artwork windows list JPG + PNG's at the same time.
