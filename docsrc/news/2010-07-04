Again just a couple of things, but they improve the puddletag experience immensely.

New Stuff
---------

* FreeDB and Amazon tag sources were added.
* And puddletag can now use the MusicBrainz ArtistID if it's in a file's tag instead of searching for one. Still need to enable it for releases.
* Tag mappings for tag sources, see the tooltip in Preferences/Mappings for more info.
* And the ability to load only files based on their extension (Preferences/Tags to configure.)
* A new applicication icon created by Evan himself.

Fixes
-----

* No new fixes were entered last week, but there's a bug that completely freezes puddletag that I haven't been able to track down. I'll fix this one as soon as I find out just WTH is causing it.
