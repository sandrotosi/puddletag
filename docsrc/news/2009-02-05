This is basically a bugfix release. There are far too many fixes to list here, but some of the major ones were unicode related like:

* Unicode support in prokyon, amarok and rhythmbox libraries was fixed.
* UTF-8 is used for everything.
* puddletag's unicode issues were sorted(e.g. If the last folder you visited
* contained non-ascii characters, puddletag would give you a big F-U.
* Changing a picture using the extended tags dialog now works.

Some other interesting stuff include:
-------------------------------------

* The user interface has changed. This includes the look of the icons have improved (they're remain horrible, but still)
* If you wanna, you can use the __image tag to show the currently selected file's cover in the Tag Editor (Go to Preferences -> Tag Editor to add it)

Hmmm, most of the other changes have to do with code quality (improved, but not much) and refactoring, which I doubt you'll wanna hear about.

Anyway, the only thing I have for the next release is more powerful scripting and (maybe not, but probably) a console version.
