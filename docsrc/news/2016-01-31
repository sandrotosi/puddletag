31 January 2016 - 1.1.0
#######################

**Update**: There was a bug where puddletag would not start if you didn't have git installed. v1.1.1 released as a result.

puddletag v1.1.0 is out. This release contains minor changes made over more than a year.

This will be the last release on SourceForge. All future downloads will point to GitHub. Documentation can be found
at the new URL http://docs.puddletag.net.

I'm still looking at different options re the forum. I'll close it towards new posts within the next month.

Fixes

- Playlists not getting loaded in certain cases
- Discogs changed their API to allow OAuth. As a result you can now only lookup releases using their Discogs release id.
- Plugins are now included in default install
- Padding of total tracks number follows the same rules as padding a track number #269
- Improved matching of Amazon resources
- Filtering 'simple' values works again #253
- Bug in regex functions where extra \ can get added

Changes
