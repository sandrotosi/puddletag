14 July 2013 - 1.0.2 RC1
########################

I've been using this release since forever and consider it to work pretty well.

Still an RC though, just in case there are any showstoppers. Use the forum link
above if you run into any issues. The list of changes is larger than usual.
Checkout the :download:`changelog` for more.

If no new issues are reported I'll just rename it to 1.0.2 within a month. ;-)

New Features:
-------------

+ Dropdown in Extended Tags that works like Tag Panel. Useful for editing multiple valued fields.
+ You can now submit your tags containing MusicBrainz IDs to AcoustID. I suggest you do this.
+ Russian and Czech translations.
+ __total can be edited in Tag Panel and other places.

Fixes:
------

+ MP4 tagging not working at all. I cannot believe no one picked this up.
+ Discogs didn't return all album info.
