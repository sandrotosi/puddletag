22 January 2012 - 1.0.0beta1
############################

It's been a while I know, but I figured if I don't get this out now I might just
leave it until next year.

This is a beta, reason being that it's not anywhere near thoroughly tested, but
it does contain important stuff like.

+   Masstagging improvements with regards to both matching (courtesy of `beets <http://beets.radbox.org/>`_)   and searching.
+   $ceiling, $eql, $floor, $round scripting functions.
+   Full support for Mp3tag tag sources.
+   Support for MusicBrainz and Discogs new APIs.
+   More than one file can be written to at a time in the file-view. Just select more than one file, edit a field as normal (like album) and Bob's your aunt.

Test it out and if you find any bugs feel free to `let me know <http://code.google.com/p/puddletag/issues>`_.
