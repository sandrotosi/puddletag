This one has been a long time coming. Not much new except bugfixes, but they should lessen some of the pain that some users have been experiencing.

Fixes

+ Discogs API no longer working. Fixed it so that searches can be done using Discogs release id only.
+ Fixed comparison of boolean values in format strings.
+ Scripting function escaping wasn't working.

Changes
-------

+ All config options are stored as JSON. Should fix issues with not being able to store certain values.

Added

+ AIFF support.
+ Configuration is stored using XDG dirs. Settings are in ~/.config/puddletag and ~/.local/share/puddletag
