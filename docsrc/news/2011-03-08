This is a kind-of bugfix release. I'm releasing it before I start with some pretty major architecture-related changes.

New Features
------------

*   Cover art support for all formats (except ASF)
*   Loading master releases in the Discogs.com tag source.

Changes
-------

*   For ID3 tags, UFID frames are now only loaded if the data can be decoded to UTF8.
*   MusicBrainz artist search retrieves 100 albums by default.
*   The initial reading of a directory can be canceled now.

Fixes
-----

*   Uncaught errors for Tag Sources shouldn't leave the Tag Sources window disabled anymore.
*   Discogs artist/albums are parsed correctly instead of looking weird.
*   Amazon keyword search wasn't working at all.
*   Having periods in the Tag->Dir function were causing problems.
