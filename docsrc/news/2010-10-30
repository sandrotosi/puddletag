#######################

There's not much to this release, but I think the second 'New Feature' is pretty fundamental to puddletag's usability. Enjoy.

New Features
------------

*   The Autonumbering wizard is now a Function.
*   Fields are now case-insensitive. Which means that if a file contains a field named 'album', writing to 'ALBUM' will rename 'album' to 'ALBUM'.
*   You can add your actions as shortcuts to the Actions menu. See the tooltip for Create Shortcut in Actions dialog for details.

Fixes
-----

*   Just a couple bugs were fixed, but nothing noteworthy.

Changes
-------

*   Filenames are now written using the filesystem's encoding instead of UTF-8 (though you should be using UTF-8 anyway ;)).
*   A new logo cause the old one was getting a bit long in the tooth.
*   Functions now save their state.
*   PIL (the Python Imaging Library) is no longer a dependency.
*   I've relaxed the dependencies for the deb so that it should work on a wider range of distributions.
