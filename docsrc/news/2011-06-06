3 June 2011 - 0.10.4
####################

**Update 6 June 2011**: 0.10.6 fixes another bug not found. Think this'll be the last for now.
**Update 4 June 2011**: Tag sources were broken due to a bug not found in testing. Therefore 0.10.5 has been released.

Unless there're some critical bugs discovered in this release, then the next release will be puddletag v1. There won't be much changed except for a couple of dollops of polish. I plan to release it around the end of this month.

As for this release, there're a lot of changes, but nothing of note UI wise (except for the website theme change copied from the `Django docs <http://djangoproject.com>`_).

Quickly listed, I've added a Man page, created a slightly better looking splash screen, converted the documentation to reStructuredText and added it to the tarball. Also there's a :download:`changelog` containing most everything done and **RaphaÃ«l Rochet** became the first person to translate puddletag by providing a :ref:`French translation <translations>`.


New Features
------------

+ Much improved masstagging.
+ The :ref:`Export artwork to file <export_artwork_to_file>` Function.
+ The filter behaves like Mp3tag's. Described in :doc:`source/filter`
+ For the Discogs tag source:
    + Added the ability to retrieve track artists for Various Artist albums.
    + This required that the **involvedpeople** field be renamed to **involvedpeople_album** as a list of involved people were returned for each track too.
    + These people are added to the **involvedpeople_track** field.

Fixes
-----

+ Multiple value handling for ID3v2.3.
+ When editing actions, if a field not in the current list of fields was used, then the list of saved fields would contain only that field.
+ Undoing renaming of dirs and adding images using the Extended Tags dialog.
+ Patterns that use scripting functions in the form **$validate(arg1,,arg3)**. will work correctly in that the second argument will evaluate to an empty string instead of being discarded.

Changes
-------

+ The old Extended Tags plugin will no longer work. Use the :ref:`new one <plugin_downloads>`.
+ Unicode support for Replace with Regular Expression function.
+ **peformersortorder** has been renamed to **performersortorder** in ID3 tags.
+ Similarly the **lyrics_us** field is now **unsyncedlyrics**.
+ Renaming dirs hooks into :ref:`Tag->Dir <tag_to_dir>` function now.
+ A couple related to the QuodLibet library handling.
+ Proper error messages are now shown, differentiating whether the error occurred while writing to files or renaming dirs, files.
